# treasure_mapp

This project modifies Flutter Projects Chapter 8 to use Open Street Maps

Instead of using Google Maps, It utilizes the flutter_map and flutter_map_marker_popup dependencies along with an extension of the Marker class
Changes were also made to the state management to allow the markers to be added and removed appropriately.
